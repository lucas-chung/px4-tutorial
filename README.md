This repo was a project I wanted to finish during my undergrad, but due to changes in my research focus in grad school, I could only work on it in my spare time. It’s purely a passion project, so please go easy on me if there are any mistakes. `(*>﹏<*)′

# px4-tutorial
The problems I have encountered in learning to make drone formations will be documented again in this repository.

In the ego-planner folder, the results of Zhejiang University will be utilized to design my own UAV formation, but the project is still in progress. The video included in the folder is still just a simple step (live drone test, px4 flight control only), and will continue to work on completing it later!(ง •_•)ง

In the orb-slam folder，To minimize the impact of moving objects on SLAM mapping, we're using the YOLO neural network to filter them out.
